PyOUCH is a package that provides tools for analyzing gene expression data of multiple species using ouch(Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Models for Phylogenetic Comparative Hypotheses).

Key Features:
- Analyze gene expression data of multiple species as input.
- Utilize Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to simulate and predict the evolutionary trajectories of each species.
- Support result visualization for easy interpretation.
